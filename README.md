## *Objective:*
We intend to use computer simulations to implement Hodgkin-Huxley models of various cells.
These cells are drawn from various regions of the brain (like the visual and somatosensory
cortices) and from various animals (ferrets, rats, etc.). \
We also plot the voltages and the various constituent ion currents, along with their gating
variables. We analyse the periodicity of these currents under a repetitive spiking behaviour.
